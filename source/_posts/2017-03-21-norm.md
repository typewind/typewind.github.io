These days I'm coding with the K-means clustring. In this algorithm, we often need to calculate the distance between 2 vectors. The expression of disctace between vector x and y is:  
$$ d=\sqrt{\sum{(x_{i}-y_{i})^{2}}} $$

Depend on this expression, we can write our code as:
```python
import numpy as np
x=np.array([1,2,3,4])
y=np.array([0,1,0,1])
d = np.sqrt(((x-y)**2).sum())
print(d)
```

This code works well, but we can also use the `numpy.linalg.norm` to calculate the distance:

```python
import numpy as np
x=np.array([1,2,3,4])
y=np.array([0,1,0,1])
d = np.linalg.norm(x-y)
print(d)
```

For those guys who are struggling with the math, maybe the norm is a better choice ;)

Actually `numpy.linalg.norm` is very powerful. It can calculate different kind of normalisations by giving different value to the `ord` parameter. [Here is the doc of norm](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html)
