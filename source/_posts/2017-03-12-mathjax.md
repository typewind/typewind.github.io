# Install
Hexo supports the TeX or the LaTex by plugin `MathJax`. We only need 3 steps to install it:
1. `npm install hexo-math --save`
2. cd to the dictionary of your local blog, input:`hexo math install`
3. Add `plugins: hexo-math` into the `_config.yml`

# Fix the Conflict between Hexo and Mathjax
When Hexo render a webpage, it regards `_` between the '$$' as HTML's `<i>`. But we need to use the `_` to write the LaTex formula. Thus we need to fix this problem.

Actually this problem bothered me for nearly 2 days. Finally I found a perfect solution:
1. `npm uninstall hexo-renderer-marked --save`
2. `npm install hexo-renderer-kramed --save`

These 2-line commands means uninstall the default hexo render first and then install [hexo-renderer-kramed](https://github.com/sun11/hexo-renderer-kramed). As its Gitbub page said, hexo renderer karmed is a fork of hexo renderer marked, focusing on solving the conflict between the Hexo and Mathjax. And it works quite well :)

Now everything goes well and we can write any formula as we want.

# Usage
Use "$$" to quote a LaTex equation like:
```
$$ e^{ix}=\cos x + i\sin x $$

```

$$ e^{ix}=\cos x + i\sin x $$
