These days I tried to install the TensorFlow with VirtualEnv and encountered several problems caused by Anaconda. Fortunately I found the solution.

If your computer installed Anaconda before you install the virtualenv, then you should use the
```
conda install virtualenv
```

instead of the

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Then everything goes well now :D
