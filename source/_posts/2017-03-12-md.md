# How to use Markdown
Markdown (MD) is a simple markup language. The grammar of MD is briefer and easier than HTML/XML. To be fair, everyone can understand how to use MD in 10 minutes. :) That's why MD is becoming more and more popular in nearly years.

Actually there are lots of perfect tutorials about Markdown and this one might be the worst one. I write this just for my own practice. Hope it can help. ;P  

The official site of Markdown is [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

## Title

We can inplement at most 6 levels of title by using: 
```
#Level 1 Title
##Level 2 Title
###Level 3 Title
####Level 4 Title
#####Level 5 Title
######Level 6 Title
```


## List
**Caution:** We must add a space after the "-" (Unordered List) and "n."(Ordered List) 

Unordered list code as shown below:
```
- Element 1
* Element 2
+ Element 3
```

**Preview:**  
- Element 1
* Element 2
+ Element 3
  
The code of orderer list is:
```
1. Element1
2. Element2
```

**Preview:**  
1. Element1  
2. Element2  

## Links
This is my favourite part of MD. Just think about how to insert a hyperlink by HTML, and you'll understand my feeling.

The grammar of hyperlink in MD as shown below:
```
[link name](link address)
```

For example:
```
[These Football Times](http://thesefootballtimes.co/)
```
**Preview:**  
[These Football Times](http://thesefootballtimes.co/)

## Pictures
Because there are only 300MB free space on github, I use the [imgur](http://imgur.com/) to store my pictures. [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)is also OK.   

The grammar of the picture and the link is similar:
```
![picture name](picture link address)
```

For example: 
```
![CRUYFF14](http://imgur.com/lCW0x8B)
```

![CRUYFF14](http://imgur.com/lCW0x8B)

## Bold & Italic
The code of bold and italic as shown below:
```
**Bold**
*Italic*
```
**Preview:**  
**Bold**
*Italic*

## Code Quotes
Another my favourite part of Markdown. Plus, because of this feature, many programmers choose MD to build there own blog. 

To build a 1 line(or shorter) code quote block, use "` "  like:
```python
`print "hello world"`
```


**Caution:**  
The "`" is different from the "'"    

# Markdown and Sublime3
This part is about some useful package of markdown on sublime3. 
## Sublime3 Packages
If you didn't install Package Control, click [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)  
If you have installed Package Control, press `command + shift + P`, find `Package Control: Install Package`, then we can install these 2 useful packages.

### MarkdownEditing
MarkdownEditing can provide grammar highlight for the Markdown in Sublime 3. It also provides some useful accelerator key such as:
- input `mdi` and press `Tab`, it will generate `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")`  
- input `mdl` and press `Tab`, it will generate `[](link)`

### OmniMarkupPreviewer
OmniMarkupPreviewer(OMP) can help us preview our page in the explorer by press:  
`command + option + o`
If you want to output the MD to the HTML, press:  
`command + option + x`

# Tricks
1. To make a newline, input 2 spaces after the end of the line.
2. The space is needed after these symbols:
```
-
1. 
#
```

# Markdown and Next Theme for Hexo
The preview in OMP and my pages is different. I guess that maybe Next Theme (or Hexo) has something wrong when compile the MD. Now I'm still fixing this problem :)
