# Autoencoder
![figure2](http://i.imgur.com/IV4NDle.png)
Auto Encoders learn to “reproduce” their own input after passing it to a   lower dimensional layer.  


# Recurrent Neuron Network
- In RNN, output is fed back into hidden layer, serves as “memory”
- Useful to analyze sequences  of data, e.g. speech recognition 

# Convolutional Neuron Network
The output size is:  
$$ \frac{N-F}{stride} + 1 $$
- F: Size of filter
- N: Size of original input image
- stride: step size
Thus:
1. $$ \frac{15-3}{1} + 1 = 13 $$  
Because there are 3 filters, the output size is 13 x 13 x 3

2. $$ \frac{15-3}{2} + 1 = 7 $$  
Because there are 3 filters, the output size is 7 x 7 x 3

3. To preserve the size of the output for the stride 1 filter, we need to add the zero-paddings with:  
$$ p = \frac{F - 1}{2} $$

4. $$ p = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = 2 $$
Thus we can perserve the size of output by padding with 2 pixel border to the input image
